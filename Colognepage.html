                    Here the only beer you will find is called Kolsch, it is only brewed in cologne and is traditionally served in 0.2 litre glasses which are cylindrical. The bar man will keep refilling your glass until you put your coaster on top of it! <br>
                    <br> Crack open your beer of choice, and enjoy this city.

                        The cathedral was one of the only parts of the city which survived bombing in the second world war, it was extensively damaged, and became the centre of the cities rebuild.
